# Snake Game - JavaScript

Welcome to the Snake Game, a classic and entertaining game built with JavaScript! Control a growing snake using the arrow keys as it navigates through the game grid, trying to eat food while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls. The more food the snake consumes, the longer and faster it becomes, increasing the challenge.
